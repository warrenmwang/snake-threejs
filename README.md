## Snake Game in Three.js

### Description
Trying to brush up on my javascript. What better way to do that
than to recreate the classic Snake Game. I hope to have a fully 
functioning snake game that the player can play in a small 3D 
environment. 

The game itself is still played on a small 2D, flat screen.
I might try to expand upon it to be a 3D version like the 
one found on cool math games found [here](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-snake-3d).
